    "## Efficient Semantic Feature Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use some code that handles the tedious tokenization aspect of building LLM encoding models with our data. Our dataset is annotated at a per-word level, instead of a per-token level, so efforts need to be made to align the word annotations temporally with the features of the model. This can be done naively by using a fixed-length context window that changes per word, but this is _very slow_. Since we are dealing with large models on a tight computational budget, we want to avoid pointless recomputation as much as possible. We do this with a dynamic programming approach to minimize the number of forward passes that we will need to perform during actual feature extraction. Here, we build a set of dictionaries, `text_dict`, `text_dict2` and `text_dict3` that mark which contexts actually need to be run through the model. We use a non-fixed length sliding window which grows and shrinks at fixed intervals to minimize the number of forward passes that are required. The process can then be repeated in reverse to get the hidden state features in the proper order."
